    AVG(l.int_rate) AS avg_interest_rate
FROM 
    loans l
WHERE 
    l.loan_status = 'Fully Paid'
GROUP BY 
    l.purpose, l.verification_status
ORDER BY 
    avg_interest_rate DESC;
```

### 9. Which are the top 5 states with the highest average loan amount for 'Fully Paid' loans?
- This SQL query finds the top 5 states with the highest average loan amounts for fully repaid loans. It joins the loans and states tables, filters for 'Fully Paid' loans, groups by state, orders by average loan amount in descending order, and limits the results to the top 5 states.
```sql
SELECT 
    s.state_code,
    AVG(l.loan_amount) AS avg_loan_amount
FROM 
    loans l
JOIN 
    states s ON l.state_code = s.state_code
WHERE 
    l.loan_status = 'Fully Paid'
GROUP BY 
    s.state_code
ORDER BY 
    avg_loan_amount DESC
LIMIT 5;
```
